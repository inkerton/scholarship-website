# Scholarsnavigator
this is a scholarship website which will show all the undergraduate , post graduate, and masters scholarships available all over inia it is just a demo it needs to be refined. It will contain all the information like eligibility and process.
# Problem it solves
There is not a single website without unnecessary info. for the students to look upto. I wish to make a website for all the students (for now in India) with the largest database about all the opportunities available to them. This will solve problem of thousands of students who have the talent or skills to earn themselves such an opportunity but could not because of the lack of a vaerified resource available.
# Understanding the Solution
Scholar's navigator is the project that is supposed to solve the problem of the students. It will give info. including the timeline, process and eligibility of the students for the scholarships. 
## What's special about Scholarsnavigator?
This is supposed to be a dependable resource for the students. In India, there are many schemes which the government has provided but are not consumed by the citizens because of lack of awareness. Scholarsnavigator is meant to be precise and contains a vast database.
